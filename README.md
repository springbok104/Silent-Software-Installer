# üß∞ Silent Software Installer (Archived)

This PowerShell script automates the silent installation of a set of common desktop applications and applies system configuration tweaks. It was originally built for post-deployment use in a German language environment and includes unattended installation for Adobe Reader DC, Firefox, WinRAR, VLC, Java, and Adblock Plus.

The script also sets folder view defaults, adjusts registry settings, disables UAC, optionally runs Windows Updates, and creates a scheduled task to open the post-install log.
